# LangGraph-RAG-System
This project is a fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent built with LangGraph and Ollama. It's designed to answer questions about a specific PDF document by using locally-run language models (llama3.2) and embedding models (nomic-embed-text), ensuring data privacy and eliminating the need for API keys.
